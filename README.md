Snake the Gayme
As a user, I want a simple game that can pass the time and won’t consume much data nor battery. I want minimal interaction before starting the game, no logging in, no personal info needed, no need to save my progress. I want a clean design for my simple game, but nothing boring. The user controls should be intuitive. While the game remains straight-forward. A pun-filled theme would be entertaining, with niche cultural references for me, the target user. The objective of the game should be obvious with a quirky “winner winner chicken dinner” pun, and upon death I would like the option to restart from the beginning.
